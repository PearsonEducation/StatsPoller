Release 2.2
 * New Postgres metric collector -- implemented in the main Java app
 * New 'Database querier' metric collector -- for querying & collecting arbitrary metrics from databases
 * MySQL metric collector now supports MySQL 5.7+
 * Bugfix for mysql collector -- hostname wasn't correct in some cases

Release 2.1
 * Set Xms in statspoller.profile
 * Library updates
 * Redirect to systemctl in the init.d script (if appropriate)
 * Fixed outputting of memory pools usage percents for JMX metrics when using Java 1.8 JVMs
 * Modified output connection timeouts to be less restrictive

Release 2.0
 * Restructured Java packages to be more intuitively organized
 * Removed the vast majority of the plugin-based Linux metric collectors. Replaced with equivalent metric collectors that are built into the main Java app.
 * New MongoDB metric collector -- implemented in the main Java app.
 * New MySQL metric collector -- implemented in the main Java app.
 * Several new configuration options - see example_application.properties.
 * Configuration is now more automated, so less fields need to be configured.
 * Hostname can now be used as a variable in when setting 'global_metric_name_prefix'
 * Improved documentation
 * Improved/simplified Linux init.d script
 * Config file now expects all times are in seconds (instead of milliseconds). To use milliseconds (for compatibility with old releases), enable legacy_mode.
 * An RPM is now built as part compiling StatsPoller via a Maven goal. RPM logic is in pom.xml. Some of the logic/permissions of the RPM have changed.
 * Bug fixes

Release 1.7-beta
 * Major restructuring of the internal code. Inherits lots of code from StatsAgg.
 * Supports outputting to OpenTSDB (Telnet & HTTP)

Release 1.6
 * 'global_metric_name_prefix_value' now defaults to the hostname of the system that is running StatsPoller
 * JMX collector memory utilization optimizations
 * JMX collector supports custom JMX service urls
 * Support gathering Wildfly JMX metrics
 * New config option -- 'jmx_collect_string_attributes'. Allows JMX attribute strings to be collected.
 * New metric collectors for df, mpstat, iostat -- written in bash/python for more efficiency. Should also be CentOS 7 compatible.
 * Updates to mongo/tokumx collector
 * New metric collectors -- process monitor, file counter, and MySQL querier
