# Apache HTTP Server Collector

The 'Apache HTTP' collector collects Apache HTTP metrics from a deployment of Apache HTTP server. For this functionality to work, Apache's 'server-status' module must be enabled (preferably with 'extended status' enabled), and StatsPoller must be able to reach it. StatsPoller will connect to, download, and parse the host:port/server-status?auto page generated by Apache HTTP server. StatsPoller can run up to 10,000 Apache HTTP collectors from a single StatsPoller deployment.

### Metrics

Output may vary by version of Apache HTTP. A breakdown of the available metrics can be found on Apache's HTTP server's website.

* Available : Was StatsPoller able to connect to Apache HTTP? Outputs 1 if true, 0 if false.
* Total Accesses : The total number of accesses to Apache HTTP since the service was started.
* Total_kBytes : The total number of kilobytes served by Apache HTTP since the service was started.
* CPULoad : The current percentage CPU used by each worker and in total by all workers combined.
* Uptime : This reflects how long Apache HTTP server has been running, in seconds.
* ReqPerSec : The average number of requests per second.
* BytesPerSec : The average number of bytes per second.
* BytesPerReq : The average number of bytes per request.
* BusyWorkers : The current number of worker serving requests.
* IdleWorkers : The current number of idle workers.
* ConnsTotal : The current number of connections.
* ConnsAsyncWriting : The current number of connections that are asynchronously writing.
* ConnsAsyncKeepAlive : The current number of connections that are asynchronously in a keep-alive state.
* ConnsAsyncClosing : The current number of connections that are asynchronously in a closing state.
